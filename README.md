<h1>Ol3 + Mapzenâ€™s vector tile </h1>      
The company Mapzen offers the coverage of OpenStreetMap base layer data as vector tiles (<a href="https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles/">https://mapzen.com/projects/vector-tiles/</a>) . 
I saw some examples with Mapbox and d3.js but not with ol3. Ol3 is wide-spread used 
and i wanted test it with vector tiles.

Test on Chrome, FF and Ms-Edge
Next step: Ol3 can read also topojson, it will be nice to use it sas as alternative to geojson.
